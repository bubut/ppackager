# PPAckager

PPAckager is the gap to simplicity Ubuntu needed but could not do alone. The PPA (Personal Package Archives) system provided by Ubuntu is a great way to set up software for Ubuntu that can be easily updated, and as many hope, one day be in the Ubuntu Software Center. The problem is that applications have to be officially checked and verified by Canonical (makers of Ubuntu) to be allowed in their Software Center, meaning that many of the PPA's, filled with applications used by many on a daily basis and even newer versions of applications in the Software Center, have to be installed using the terminal, which for many veteran users is perfectly fine, but is intimidating to new users who had used Windows and Mac and had never used what they had only seen in the movies. This makes the adoption of Linux, in this case specifically Ubuntu, which is known as the most user-friendly of all the Linux distributions, more difficult and, because of this, small in numbers. That's where PPAckager comes in. It is not a replacement to the Software Center, but more of an add-on. It allows for a one-click install to the newest versions of applications both in and not in the Software Center, as well as applications that are compatible with Linux, but are not in the Ubuntu PPA's, such as Spotify, CeltX, and Komodo Edit. This will be a never-ending process, and will take time to reach a level that will give almost-full satisfaction, but with the communities' support, reminding up when certain applications have updated or when a certain application needs to be added, it can be done. Hopefully this becomes one of the many tools that helps bring Linux to being the dominant desktop OS!.

## Features

* Easy one-click installs for hundreds of applications, including Spotify, CeltX, PlayOnLinux, Drawers, Everpad, Oracle Java, and so much more!
* Decent (and one day, hopefully, nice) UI!
* The "Bare Necessities" Package, a one-click install for any fresh install of Ubuntu, to have your machine up and running with all the basics to get on to enjoying your machine!
* My undying love and devotion!

## Download

Will be put here once there is something done! The package we put here will work directly with a PPA, so you don't have to worry about updating, which this application will do a lot of and frequently, because we got your back! ;D
